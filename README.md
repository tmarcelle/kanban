# Simple KanBan Board
Single Page kanban made with html, petite-vue, purecss for simple agile development

## Why was this created
I wanted a simple Kanban board that didn't require me to signup or pay to use.

## How to use
Pretty straightforward, download the kanban-board.html file, open it in a web browser, or add it to your website. Data is saved to localstorage in the web-browser, so if the cache is cleared, data will be lost. The export button can be used to download a .txt file of the data, which can be re-imported. Once a user-story is created, you can drag the card to other columns or click on the text to edit. Everything else should be fairly self-explanitory. 

## Disclaimer
This is in no way shape or form a commercial product, so use at your own risk. It does not save data to a backend and has only been tested for simple tasks.

## FAQ
1. Will there be updates to the file?
   - This was inteded as a one off, but I may do some updates over time.
2. Why is the code format/syntax inconsistent?
   - As with every project I build with petite-vue,I try to explore several methods of achieveing the same outcome, so I have additional references for future projects.
3. What's up with the CSS Style?
   - Again, the goal was to see what could be done with the on a single page, so I tried to keep things as simple as possible. I went as minimal as possible
4.  Will there be more apps like this?
    - I do intend to create more apps that follow this pattern.
5. What do I do if something is broken or not working correctly?
   - Feel free to fork the repo and update as you see fit.
6. Are there data integrity checks?
   - Yes, but minimal.
